# Encryption
## Introduction
  This project was done when I was undergraduate student, the code was well written and organized. But what this code did was basically that it uesed DES encryption method to encrypt a image and then use the Huffman code to encode the output from the encryption.
## Instructions
  The code was written in the Visual Studio 2010. For your convience, I even did not delete the debug file. So you are able to run the code directly. The way you want to run the code is just to pull the code, and use the Visual Studio to open it and run.
